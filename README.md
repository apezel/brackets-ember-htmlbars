Handlebars templates highlighter for Brackets
===============================

A syntax highlighting plugin for [Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/) in the [Brackets editor](http://brackets.io/).

After installation you will get mixed syntax highlightning for html and handlebars in .hbs and .handlebars files.

**Note** Earlier versions of this plugin supported the .hbr extension as well since the original author used that back in the days. I haven't found any other references to it so it has been removed in a recent version. If you need this then please open up an issue or create a PR for it and we'll get it into the next release.

Installing
----------

The easiest way to install this extension is to use the [Extension Manager](github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions) in Brackets.

If you want the cutting-edge version you can always clone this repo and manually install it into the brackets extension folder (you can find it in your system by going to Help > Show Extensions Folder in Brackets).

Contributing
------------

This project was created and earlier maintaned by [Bryan Eliott](https://github.com/Fordi). If you want to contribute features or fixes now the new maintainer is [Karl-Johan Sj√∂gren](https://github.com/karl-sjogren) and this repo will be used.

Please adhere to the codestyled used in main.js, we use two spaces for indentation, not tabs, not ever again (sorry Bryan!). There is a gruntfile included in the project that enforces some basic rules using JShint.
